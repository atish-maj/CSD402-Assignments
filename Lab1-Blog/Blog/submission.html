<article><header><h1 class="arthead">Spark email app ensures you’ll never forget an important task
</h1></header>

<p>Spark, one of the finest third-party email clients for Mac and iOS, just got a big update that will ensure you never forget another important task.

The app, developed by the terrific team at Readdle, now boasts seamless integrations for popular reminders apps like Todoist, Wunderlist, Things, and even Apple’s own Reminders app.

<p>Readdle builds some of the best productivity apps for iOS, so it’s no surprise that its first email client, launched last May, is downright awesome. It has everything you could want in an email app, and plenty of other useful features you’ll struggle to find elsewhere.

The latest is integrations for other popular productivity apps — including Reminders, Things, 2Do, OmniFocus, Wunderlist, Todoist, Trello, Asana, Evernote, OneNote, and Bear — that make keeping track of important tasks a breeze.
</p>“With dozens of emails we receive daily, we keep losing important ones in between newsletters and mile long discussion threads,” Readdle says. “Details for specific tasks get lost. All of it slows us and our teams down. There is a complete disconnect between our inboxes and the task management tools we use. Not anymore.”</p>
<p>
	 Here’s how the new integrations work: When you receive an email that you need to follow up, an attachment that you need for a project, or a request you must carry out later, you can export it to the productivity app of your choice.
Each app has a customized export window that matches the style of the service, so buttons for Evernote are green, and those for Asana are red. If applicable, you can assign tasks to a member of your team, specify when they are due, add tags, and more.

<p>For now, these integrations are only available on Mac, but Readdle promises they’re coming to Spark for iOS, too. In the meantime, the latest update for iOS adds Touch ID protection, and PDF integration, allowing you to edit and send PDF documents without leaving the app.</p>

<section><article><header> <h1 class= "arthead">Linksys’ new router puts your gaming needs before everyone else’s</h1>	</header>
<figure ><img id="router" src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?quality=100&image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fb69e6bbbafd5b935eb18fd72f99edd18%2F205589166%2Flinksys-wrt32x-gaming-router-2017-08-22-01-ed.jpg&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=09c261430c9bef90adecbafd8693bc5680604b3a" height=250em width=500em ></figure>

<h2 id="sub">If you're playing "Overwatch" or streaming, it'll prioritize that data.</h2>

<p>You might not think twice about your router (unless it crashes), but gamers looking for every edge do. For those folks, Linksys has unveiled the $300 WRT32X Gaming Router, a model it developed in collaboration with Rivet Networks. It uses that company's "Killer Prioritization Engine" to reduce ping times by as much as 77 percent, Linksys claims, provided you have a Razer, Alienware, MSI or other PC with the same tech.</p>

<p>The idea is relatively simple. The WRT32X determines which devices connected to it also have Killer Networking hardware. It then works with the network to "prioritize important gaming and video networking traffic above other devices in the home." If bandwidth is saturated, the device simply lowers what's available to other apps and users. PCs equipped with the router can also tell it to reduce priority for less important traffic like downloading when you're gaming.</p>

<p>In other words, it will reduce the quality of your granny's knitting tutorial videos so that you can blast tanks and call your crew on Overwatch. At the same time, it's customizable so you can prioritize streaming video, for instance. "The WRT32X will [then] treat those packets like gold and ensure nothing in the home slows down those streaming video networking packets," notes Linksys in the PR.</p>
